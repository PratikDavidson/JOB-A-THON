## Problem Statement: 

To predict the CLTV based on the user and policy data of one of the leading insurance companies in India (VahanBima).

### Given data:
    Input Variables:
        Id - Unique identifier of a customer
        Gender - Gender of the customer
        Area - Area of the customer
        Qualification - Highest Qualification of the customer
        Income - Income earned in a year (in rupees)
        marital_status - Marital Status of the customer {0: Single, 1: Married}
        Vintage - No. of years since the first policy date
        claim_amount - Total Amount Claimed by the customer (in rupees)
        num_policies - Total no. of policies issued by the customer
        Policy- Active policy of the customer
        type_of_policy - Type of active policy  
    Target Variable:
        Cltv - Customer lifetime value



## Solution:

### Approach-1: 
* Preprocessing (EDA/Data Engineering):
    * Checked missing values (None Found).
    * Converted the categorical data into nominal and ordinal values using MsExcel.
    * Scaled the numerical data (claim_amount & cltv) using sklearn MinMax().
    * Checked relationships between input and target variable (Correlation)
* Processing (Model Creation and training/validating):
    * Looped through Regression models (RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge) to get the best r2_score possible with the above pre-processed data â€“ Found GradientBoostingRegressor performed well in comparison to all the models with a r2_score of 0.1603. 
### Approach-2:
* Based on the above preprocessed data, a deep neural network is trained to see if it can be used to solve the problem statement.



### Approach-3:
* Used CatBoostRegressor wherein preprocessing steps like conversion and scaling are not required as it is capable of giving quick results without the need of any preprocessing steps to save time.
